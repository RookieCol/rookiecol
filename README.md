## 👋 Hi there, I'm Juan  
#### Full Stack & Blockchain Developer | Web3 Builder | Tokenization Enthusiast

### 🧠 About Me  
I'm a full-stack developer with a background in Industrial Engineering and 3+ years of experience building scalable systems across Web2 and Web3. I specialize in backend development with **NestJS**, **microservices**, and **event-driven architectures**, and I’m passionate about creating seamless developer and user experiences on the blockchain.

I transitioned into tech from a background in IoT and sales, and since then, I’ve worked on innovative solutions involving **tokenized assets**, **cross-chain interoperability**, and **developer tooling**. I've contributed to multiple open-source projects, participated in and won Web3 hackathons, and built systems deployed on **AWS (ECS + RDS)** using modern DevOps workflows.
